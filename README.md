# Important
As we are going to use differential drive controller from ros and need to communicate with ros, make sure you have installed 
these plugins. If not, use the following commands in terminal to install ros controllers and gazebo plugins for ros.
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-gazebo*
```
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ros-cont*
```
